UPDATE 

You already assign env variables inside ft_echo, ghir heyedha,

btw dont worry about env_list f lmain,

// check_quotes seg faults at this test: echo '"'"'"'"'ana      'ss"'"'"'"' fgdfg
ill fix it tomorrow

// ft_handle_quotes breaks too in some tests, i know what the issue is, will be fixed tomorrow
echo '"'hi"wheoq""@'"
echo '"'"'"'"'ana      'ss"'"'"'"' fgdfg
echo "'"hello"''"'"'hi"wheoq""@'"


echo '$HOME'   should print $HOME
echo "$HOME"   should print /Users/mbaioumy
echo $HO"ME"   should print  ME
echo $"HOME"    should print HOME
echo "'$HOME'"	should print /Users/mbaioumy
echo '"$HOME"'	should print "$HOME"	

UPDATE

added ft_string_examiner to handle everything from quotes to $ inside parseexec
you can comment it and work with the commented lines
