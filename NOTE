echo '$HOME'   should print $HOME
echo "$HOME"   should print /Users/mbaioumy
echo $HO"ME"   should print  ME
echo $"HOME"    should print HOME
echo "'$HOME'"	should print '/Users/mbaioumy'
echo '"$HOME"'	should print "$HOME"	


********************************************************************

UPDATE

the only test not working yet, i know where the issue is, echo $HO"ME"   should print  ME


REDIR UPDATE

fixed the issue with both files in the same string, they\'re seperated now
and null terminated, there\'s a seg fault from your side idk why


REDIR UPDATE #2

Added ft_redir_test to test trees with redirs, touched a bit of your code on ft_redir just to silence some errors,
i tested the function doesn't bug or seg faults, check from your part if its working properly
uncomment ft_check_cmd on the main, and the normal function if it doesnt work.

REDIR UPDATE #3

multiple redirections are now working but only if they re from the same type
Im still thinking of a solution
we have problems in tests:
<a cat <b <c only the content of c should be displayed
<a cat <b <c (b) doesnt exist so nothing is displayed and an error shows
cat <> a only the input redir works the output redir is ignored
ls > < a syntax error

and the heredoc
